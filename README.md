# InQuire

## Server-Side

This is the back-end server repository for the final project InQuire.

Head over [here](https://github.com/lxg1992/LHL-Final-Client) for the front-end repository as well as the instructions for installation

## Online Instance

There is a demo of this application hosted on Netlify pinging a Heroku server over here:

https://hungry-varahamihira-549516.netlify.com/

It takes up to a minute to restart the Heroku instance that serves the back-end to this project

> If you encounter a "no such resource on this server" error then simply click back on Netlify's UI for error handling and it should take you back to the dashboard
